- Error handling and validations

### Out of Scope
- Performance testing
- Security penetration testing
- Full cross-device matrix

## Test Types

- Functional
- Regression (basic)
- Exploratory

## Entry Criteria
- Build deployed to test environment
- Test accounts are available
- No known blocker defects for core flows

## Exit Criteria
- Smoke tests passed
- No open critical/blocker defects
- Major defects have workarounds or are accepted by stakeholders

## Risks
- Unstable test environment
- Missing test data
- Requirements changes during testing
